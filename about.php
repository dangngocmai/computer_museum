    <p> The University of Waterloo Computing Museum is university-based museum, whose purpose is to collect, preserve and interpret the history of computing at the University of Waterloo (UW) and related organizations of the geographic region. <br> <br>
        
       The time period it focuses on is primarily from 1957 (the year UW was established) to the present. The museum collects various computing related artifacts: hardware, software, documents, books, manuals, and other related cultural artifacts. <br><br>
       
          As appropriate, it collaborates and cooperates with other UW units that hold overlapping interests, such as the University Archives and Records Management or various Alumni offices.<br><br>
        
          The museum has physical and online exhibits, research, teaching, public events and publications. <br>  </p>

    <h2 class = "what">History of Computer Museum</h2>
    <p>  Waterloo now is one of the main technical regions - "Canadian Sillicon Valley". Therefore, the development of technology is very important. In 2017, the Computer Science Department managers, Mr. Lawrence Folland  and Mr. Scott Campbell first came to the ideas making the university's very own exhibit. 
        <br> <br> They started to spend their free-time finding materials, including old discarded computers. The museum required a lot of time to manage the software, fix the computers and catalogue their artifacts. The old equipment went to central stores, and was later treated as e-waste. If it had value, they sold it right away.  <br><br>
                
 The museum has parts from the first mainframe on campus, dating all the way back to the mid-80s. There is a slide roll and a mechanical calculator from the 19th century, and even a WWII bombsight device. They are all displayed in Davis Centre.  <br></p>
